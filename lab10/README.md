### Brief introduction
The code in the repository "lab10" implements ..
See below for more details.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I worked alone for this lab, I did my best and I am grateful to receive advice to improve the solution and learn more.

### The steps that led me to a solution:

- 
   
- Explore the possibilities: 
       
  
    
- Start to code:
  
- Parameter tuning:
  
- Exploration vs exploitation:
   

 
### Some results:
>[!NOTE]
> Trying my code you might get different results from the ones below. This depends on several factors: 
> Anyway the results do not vary much with each run of the algorithm with the same values for the parameters of . . .
